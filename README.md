# CSG: Chemical Structure Generator

![CSG Demo](img/csg_demo.gif)
<br/>
<br/>
A simple Chemical Structure Generator.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (>= v3.8)
- PyQt5 (optional; >= v5.15.0 required for graphical front-end)
- Matplotlib (>= v3.3.1)

## Install Dependencies

Change to the source directory and type the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Workaround for macOS Big Sur on the Apple M1 chip

The required version of PyQt5 cannot be installed using pip on M1 MacBooks
(tested on the MacBook Air) as of the time of writing. A workaround for this is
as follows:

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
- Run the following commands for PyQt5 v5.15.4 running on Python 3.9 (replace
  versions in the command appropriately):

  ```
  brew install pyqt5
  mv /opt/homebrew/Cellar/pyqt@5/5.15.4_2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/* /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/
  ```
- Install matplotlib using pip:

  ```
  pip3 install matplotlib
  ```
- Run CSG:

  ```
  ./csg.py
  ```

## Usage

```
